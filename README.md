## Setting up Development Environment
  We are using Java to develop the robot program. You need to install Java 8 JDK, not Java 9, eclipse for java developers, and the WPILIB plugins for eclipse.
  See the following site for detailed instructions. https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java
